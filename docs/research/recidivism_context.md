# Research Analysis: Effectiveness of Psychological Interventions in Prison (Beaudry et al., 2021)

## Relevance to Five Tiers Connect
This systematic review strongly validates the core mission of Five Tiers Connect ("Community Scheduling & **Reentry Support**").

### Key Findings
1.  **Continuity is Key:** The paper concludes that "interventions that ensure **continuity of care in community settings** should be prioritised."
    *   *Application:* Five Tiers Connect creates this exact continuity by linking justice-involved youth with community anchors (barbershops/salons) for ongoing support/mentorship post-release.
2.  **Therapeutic Communities Work:** "Therapeutic communities were associated with decreased rates of recidivism," unlike generic CBT which showed mixed/no results in isolation.
    *   *Application:* The "Cohort" and "Partner" features in Five Tiers essentially digitize a "Therapeutic Community" model distributed across the city.
3.  **Limitations of Prison-Only Tech:** Interventions delivering *only* inside prison without community linkage often fail.
    *   *Application:* Reinforces the need for the "Connect" part of the platform (external partners).

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Platform Positioning:** Use this research to justify funding/grants. The platform isn't just "booking haircuts"; it is a **"Community Continuity Intervention"**.
- **Feature Roadmap:**
    - **Resource Library:** Add a section for Cohort Members to access community resources (beyond just crisis support).
    - **Mentorship Tracking:** Highlight the *relationship* aspect (check-ins) rather than just transactional appointments.

# Research Analysis: Incarceration, Reentry, and Communities (Morenoff & Harding, 2014)

## Relevance to Five Tiers Connect
This paper introduces the critical concept of the **"Pernicious Feedback Loop"**—where mass incarceration destabilizes communities, which in turn makes those communities less capable of supporting reentry, leading to more incarceration.

### Key Concepts
1.  **Coercive Mobility:** The constant churning of people in/out of prison destroys "social capital" (trust, networks) in neighborhoods.
    *   *Application:* Five Tiers Connect acts as a **"Digital Social Capital"** stabilizer. Even if a user moves or is unstable, their digital connection to the Partner Network remains constant.
2.  **Institutional "Supervision Regimes":** Success depends on how institutions (parole, police) interact with the individual.
    *   *Application:* The app provides a transparent "positive track record" (check-ins, appointments) that can be shown to parole officers to prove compliance and stability.
3.  **Resource Density & Access:** Returning prisoners often land in "resource deserts" or areas where services are over-taxed.
    *   *Application:* The proposed **"Resource Hub"** addresses this information asymmetry, putting clustered resources (housing, jobs) directly in their pocket.

## Strategic Recommendations
- **"Loop Breaker" Narrative:** Position the platform as a tool to *break* the feedback loop by artificially injecting stability (scheduled commitments) into unstable environments.
- **Resource Hub Priority:** The paper confirms that lack of access to *institutional resources* is a major failure point. Expanding the "Crisis" page into a full "Resource Directory" is evidence-based.

# Research Analysis: "Stepping Up" Initiative (Mental Health & Incarceration)

## Relevance to Five Tiers Connect
The "Stepping Up" initiative focuses on redirecting people with mental illnesses *out* of the justice system and *into* treatment. This validates the platform's role as a **"Connection Engine"** to behavioral health services.

### Key Concepts
1.  **Diverting to Treatment:** The core goal is to "increase connections to evidence-based treatment" to prevent incarceration.
    *   *Application:* The **Resource Hub** is not just a phonebook; it is a **Diversion Tool**. If a user finds a mental health clinic via the app instead of acting out in public, that is a successful diversion.
2.  **Data Tracking & Outcomes:** Success is measured by "increasing connections" and "reducing recidivism".
    *   *Application:* We must track click-through rates on Resource cards (anonymously) to show "Attempted Connections" as a key impact metric.
3.  **Co-occurring Disorders:** 75% of inmates with serious mental illness also have substance use problems.
    *   *Application:* The Resource Hub MUST have a dedicated, robust **Substance Use/Rehab** section, separate from general mental health.

## Strategic Recommendations
- **"Connection" Metric:** In the Analytics dashboard, track a new metric: **"Community Connections Made"** (clicks on resource links/calls). This aligns directly with Stepping Up's key measures.
- **Self-Screening (Future):** The initiative emphasizes "validated screening tools". Future state could include a private "Self-Check" tool that recommends resources based on answers.
