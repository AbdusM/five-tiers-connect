# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Next Best Action (NBA) Framework
**Goal:** Reduce recidivism by identifying negative thinking patterns and applying real-time positive decision-making.

## 1. Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) Approach
**Core Mechanism:** Change the *thinking* to change the *behavior*.

### A. Identify Maladaptive Thoughts
*   **Goal:** Recognize distorted thinking that fuels impulsive/criminal actions.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Entitlement:** "I deserve this because..."
    *   **Irrational Logic:** "If I don't do this, I look weak."
    *   **Minimizing Harm:** "It's not that big of a deal, they have insurance."

### B. Challenge & Reframe
*   **Action:** Actively replace antisocial thoughts with healthy, realistic perspectives.
*   **Technique:** "Stop. Is this thought helping me? What is the consequence?"
*   **Reframed:** "If I do this, I lose my freedom. It's not worth it."

### C. Develop Skills
*   **Emotional Regulation:** Managing intense anger/fear without lashing out.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Finding constructive solutions to challenges (e.g., "I'm broke -> I need a job," not "I need to steal").
*   **Social Skills:** Communicating requirements effectively and respectfully.
*   **Impulse Control:** The "Pause" before the "Action."

## 2. Next Best Action (NBA) / Strengths-Based Approach
**Core Mechanism:** A tactical, real-time decision framework.

### A. Recognize Triggers
*   Identify specific people, places, or emotional states (HALT: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) that lead to regression.

### B. Pause & Plan (The Algorithm)
1.  **Trigger Event:** Conflict or Temptation occurs.
2.  **PAUSE:** Stop the automatic reaction.
3.  **ASK:** "What is the *best next step* I can take right now to stay out of trouble and move towards my goals?"

### C. Leverage Strengths & Supports
*   **Mentorship:** Call a mentor (Use Contacts).
*   **Community:** Go to a safe place (Use Resources).
*   **Family:** Lean on healthy ties.

## 3. Key Programs
*   **Thinking for a Change (T4C):** Integrated CBT + Social Skills + Problem Solving.
*   **Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT):** Focuses on moral reasoning growth.
*   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Mindfulness and distress tolerance.

## 4. Application to Five Tiers Connect
We can digitize these concepts into specific tools:
1.  **The "Pause" Button:** A panic-button style feature for immediate de-escalation.
2.  **Mindset Log:** A digital "Thought Record" to practice Reframing.
3.  **NBA Recommender:** Suggesting "Call Mentor" or "Visit Community Center" when stress is high.
