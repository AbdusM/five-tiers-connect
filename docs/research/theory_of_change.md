# Theory of Change: Five Tiers Connect
*Strategic alignment with evidence-based strategies to reduce recidivism.*

## Core Pillars & Platform Mapping

### 1. Addressing Root Causes & Prevention
*Strategies focused on interrupting pathways to prison.*

| Strategy | Five Tiers Connect Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Economic Opportunity** | **Partner Network:** Connecting youth to local businesses (Barbers/Salons) for potential apprenticeships and informal mentorship. | ✅ Live |
| **Mental Health** | **Crisis Support:** Direct access to emergency hotlines and support resources. | ✅ Live |
| **Housing & Stability** | *Future Opportunity:* Add "Housing Resources" to the Support directory. | 🚧 Proposed |

### 2. Reentry & Support
*Ensuring successful transition to break cycles of crime.*

| Strategy | Five Tiers Connect Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Support Services** | **Vouchers & Check-ins:** Reducing financial friction for basic needs (haircuts/hygiene) and maintaining regular contact via "Daily Check-ins". | ✅ Live |
| **Community Connection** | **Community Barber/Salon Model:** Leveraging trusted community anchors as safe spaces for reintegration. | ✅ Live |
| **Employer Support** | **Partner Profiles:** Highlighting "Youth Friendly" businesses that are open to supporting justice-involved individuals. | ✅ Live |

### 3. Community & Policy
*Systemic changes and advocacy.*

| Strategy | Five Tiers Connect Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Restorative Justice** | **Restorative approach:** The platform focuses on *connection* and *support* rather than surveillance. | 🧠 Core Philosophy |
| **Breaking the "Feedback Loop"** | **Stability Injection:** By digitizing the "Community Anchor" (barbershop), we provide a stable node in the user's life, countering the "Coercive Mobility" that destroys social capital. | 🧠 Core Philosophy |
| **Advocate for Change** | **Data & Analytics:** Collecting anonymized impact data (appointments kept, check-ins) to prove the efficacy of community-based reentry models to policymakers. | ✅ Live |
| **Diversion & Treatment** | **Resource Hub (Mental Health):** Acting as a "Digital Diversion" tool by connecting users to behavioral health resources *before* a crisis leads to arrest (aligning with "Stepping Up" goals). | 🚧 Phase 6 |

## Strategic Roadmap
Based on this framework, the platform should evolve from "Appointment Booking" to a holistic **"Reentry Success Hub"**.

**Next Priorities:**
1.  **Resource Hub Expansion:** Expand specific sections for Housing, Legal Aid, and Education under a consolidated "Resources" tab (Addressing the "Resource Desert" problem).
2.  **Impact Metrics:** Enhance the Analytics dashboard to track "Stability Indicators" (consistent check-ins, voucher usage) and **"Community Connections"** (resource access).
