# Five Tiers Connect – Beta Review & Partner Alignment Brief

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Status:** Agreed & Aligned

This document is intended for internal partner review and alignment between Five Tiers leadership and development partner Abdus. It summarizes the current beta platform, confirms shared assessment of its strength, and outlines next steps toward pilot and funding readiness.

## 1. Overview
Five Tiers Connect is a community-based stabilization and reentry support platform designed to provide real-time decision support, trusted human connection, and access to dignity-restoring services for both open community users and justice-involved cohorts.

## 2. What the Beta Successfully Demonstrates
The current beta demonstrates a strong, functional foundation across multiple domains:

*   **Crisis support and de-escalation tools**
*   **Mindset check-ins aligned with cognitive behavioral principles**
*   **Trusted mentor connection at moments of risk**
*   **Appointment scheduling with community partners**
*   **Voucher-based access to services**
*   **Clean, low-cognitive-load, mobile-first user experience**

## 3. Shared Assessment (Five Tiers + Development Partner)
Both Five Tiers leadership and development partner Abdus agree that the beta is:

*   **Thoughtfully designed**
*   **Trauma-informed by default**
*   **Functionally strong for a beta-stage product**
*   **Unique in its integration of behavioral support and community services**
*   **Well-positioned for pilot funding and institutional partnerships**

## 4. Key Strengths to Preserve
The following elements are considered core strengths and should remain intact as development continues:

*   **Respectful, non-punitive language**
*   **User autonomy and choice-based navigation**
*   **Human connection prioritized over automation**
*   **Community-rooted service model (barbershops, salons, mentors)**
*   **Crisis response that supports safety without surveillance**

## 5. Recommended Enhancements (Not Structural Changes)
These recommendations are intended to support institutional approval and scalability, not to change the core vision:

*   **Add clear emergency disclaimers (911 / 988)** for legal and safety alignment.
*   **Visually distinguish cohort users from open community users** (non-stigmatizing).
*   **Introduce an admin-only analytics dashboard** for engagement tracking.
*   **Add verified partner trust indicators** for community locations.

## 6. Readiness & Next Phase
Based on the current state of the beta, Five Tiers Connect is assessed as:

*   **Pilot-ready with minor refinements**
*   **Fundable with appropriate documentation**
*   **Aligned with public safety, youth engagement, and reentry goals**
*   **Suitable for City, foundation, and institutional partnership discussions**

## 7. Agreed Next Steps
*   Finalize pilot documentation (PRD, evaluation framework).
*   Build admin analytics and reporting layer.
*   Prepare City Council and foundation-facing materials.
*   Continue coordinated development between Five Tiers and Abdus.
